1  Insertion_sort.py - it starts the first loop in right direction and second loop will go in left from the chosen point.
 
3  Selection_sort.py - it goes through charcter by charcter and swaps them based on lower and higher number.
 
4  bubble_sort.py - it goes from bottom to top in reverse order pushes(swaps) lower charcter upwards and sorts it.

1. What is an array?

    - An array is a data structure in Python that can store multiple values of the same data type under a single variable name. 
      It is similar to a list, but unlike a list, all the elements in an array must be of the same data type. Arrays are not 
      built-in data types in Python, but you can use the `array` module to work with arrays in Python ยนโด.

2. Basic characteristics of arrays:

    - **Contiguous memory:** In an array, the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. This means that the elements 
        are stored one after the other in memory, making it easy to access them using their index.

    - **Fixed size:** The size of an array is fixed at the time of creation. Once an array is created, you cannot change its 
        size. If you need to add or remove elements from an array, you need to create a new array with the desired size and copy 
        the elements from the old array to the new array.
        
    - **Indexed elements:** Each element in an array is assigned an index number, starting from 0. You can access the elements 
        of an array using their index number. For example, if you have an array `arr` with 5 elements, you can access the first 
        element using `arr[0]`, the second element using `arr[1]`, and so on.
